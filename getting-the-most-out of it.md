Some tips for getting the most out of it:

1. Expand the response window so you can read the code as it writes it.  I have been using this [gist](https://gist.github.com/shane935/34ef6905141e2dc8de68bc200f246595)
2. Ask it to act as if it is pair programming and provide comments as it writes, this will give you some context for what it is doing and help you remain engaged and in a coding mindset ast it writes
3. Use GPT 4 if possible, it gives better responses and its slower speed allows you to follow along as it writes in a more natural way
