Complex algorithms should have a unit test checking the boundaries of the functionality.  As an example a function that loops through an array and displays a list of products would not need to be unit tested as this is covered easily using the integration tests where as a function that displays a figure that describes the shipping cost of an item would require a unit test as that would require a complicated calculation based on weight, height and distance the item needs to be shipped to provide an accurate figure.
